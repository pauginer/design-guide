    <h1>Design principles</h1>
    <p>The identified principles are captured below. there are <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Design">more details in this page</a>.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>This is for everyone</h2>
      <p>We aim to support a very diverse audience as a core part of our mission. It’s a priority to help users overcome the different barriers between them and the knowledge our projects provide. These barriers include accessibility, language, device capabilities, network, and peoples’ technical expertise — among others. When improving the experience for a given group of people, we need to make sure we are not increasing the barriers for others.</p>

      <h2>Content first</h2>
      <p>People come to Wikimedia projects for their content, and our solutions should facilitate its creation, consumption, and sharing—without getting in the way. Our content (facts, images, quotes, etc.) is our most representative element, and needs to be emphasized in our solutions.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Open to collaboration</h2>
      <p>Our projects are collaborative. Discussion and sharing are key factors to consider. To support diversity and a global mission, our solutions need to provide room for extension and customization to particular needs and different perspectives.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Trustworthy yet joyful</h2>
      <p>Wikimedia projects provide reliable educational knowledge. At the same time, our projects are a source of entertainment and satisfy human curiosity. This requires us to find the right balance: we need to convey trust with our solutions but still remain entertaining and fresh.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Design for consistecy</h2>
      <p>In order to facilitate understanding it is important to rely on familiar concepts. Keeping consistency within our designs, and maintaining common patterns helps people relate quickly and easily.</p>
